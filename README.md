# Overview
Multi-page search of images, storage as local variable as well as uploading of image from user's machine. Canvas is used to add text overlay to the image, with the default text loaded from the Chuck Norris API with default and rolled jokes. Text can be changed to anything desired, and downloaded as a single image to the user's machine.

# Future Development
Sending the image as a gift via the Represent API
